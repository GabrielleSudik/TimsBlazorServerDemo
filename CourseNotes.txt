Tim's Blazor Server Demo

Start with new solution -- Blazor App -- Blazor Server App.

When you start up the boilerplate, it will look
different from the other UI apps. It includes a weather forecast,
like the API boilerplate, and also a "Counter" .razor.

-- Add the DLL from Library / Common Project --

The usual. 1. Add the "hard copy" of the .dll from the
Library project. 2. Add a reference to the .dll that's been
copied to this project. Add the dependencies from the Library
project to this .csproj file. 4. Confirm it builds.

-- Configure the DI --

Startup.cs. Add services to link to Library project.
(We also deleted weatherforecast stuff, including files.)

-- Routing --

Startup.cs.
Routing in Blazor Server is different than the other UIs we've seen.

See some notes in Error.razor too. About pathing.

Tim says there's a lot to know about Blazor;
this course will be pretty cursory (and check out his Blazor class!).

-- Add the Connection String --

Update appsettings.json with the path from TimsDinerDB properties.

-- Creating Data --
